# A-Web-Scrapper-with-ETL-to-PostgreSQL-database
In this project, I build a web scrapper to scrappe data from: football-data.co.uk website and performed Extraction Transformation &amp; loading (ETL) on the screapped data to a PostgreSQL database

Instruction on how to run code:
1.	Install a PostgreSQL engine (If you don't have one installed). Then create a database.
2.	Install all dependent libraries including: SqlAlchemy, Python Mysql connector, Pandas
3.	Copy the username & password you generated from creating a database after step 1 above.
4.	Open the source code of the Pyhthon script. Then insert the copied database username & password in the LOAD EXTRACTED DATA TO DATABASE section in the code file as well as other sections below this section where database username and password is required. 
5.	Run the Script
6.	Check the final output of the data in the PostgreSQL database you created in step 1 above.
